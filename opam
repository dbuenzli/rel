synopsis: "Relational database programming for OCaml"
description: """\
Rel is a library for programming with relational databases in OCaml.
It provides:

- Typed combinators to describe database rows and their representation
  as custom OCaml values.
- Typed combinators to describe database schemas. Schemas can be translated 
  to SQL data definitions or, conversly, generated for existing databases 
  (external schema definition).
- Automated schema changes via schema diffing.
- Raw SQL statements typing and SQL generation helpers (parametric on SQL
  dialect).
- Query language embedded in *plain* OCaml. Queries are typed,
  composable and compile to a single, flat, SQL query (experimental).
- Support for using SQLite3 databases.

Rel is distributed under the ISC license. The base library has no
dependencies. The `Rel_cli` library depends on `cmdliner`. The
`Rel_sqlite3` library depends on the C SQLite3 library (at least
v3.38.5).
