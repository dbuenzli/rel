synopsis: "Relational database programming for OCaml"
description: """\
Rel is a library for programming with relational databases in OCaml.
It provides:

* Typed combinators to describe tables and their representation 
  by client-defined OCaml values.
* Automatic database row and OCaml values translations from 
  the table descriptions.
* SQL data definition generation from the table descriptions.
* A mechanism for typing SQL statement parameters and results.
* SQL generation helpers.
* A query language embedded in *plain* OCaml. Queries are typed,
  composable and compile to a single, flat, SQL query (experimental).
* Support for SQLite3 databases (optional). Run SQL statements 
  and generate OCaml table descriptions for existing databases.

Rel is distributed under the ISC license. The basic library has no
dependencies. 

The SQLite support depends on the C SQLite3 library (at least
v3.26.2).
