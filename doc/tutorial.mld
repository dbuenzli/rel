This tutorial shows you simple steps to define a database in OCaml

{1:old Old stuff}

Having your database schema as a first class value in OCaml kills a
few unchecked stringly dependencies and allows to devise generic code
to process them. For example to derive boilerpate queries or generate
{{!Rel.Schema.pp_dot}diagrams}.

OCaml values that represent approximations of existing database
schemas can be output using the [rel] command line tool.
